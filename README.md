# Module_Thirteen_Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. Three URLs for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website are used to retrieve geographical coordinates and map magnitudes of earthquakes and tectonic plates. JavaScript and the D3.js library are used to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data. The Leaflet library is used to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
